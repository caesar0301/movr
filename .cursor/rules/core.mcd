You're working on **movr**â€”an Rlang library to process and visualize human mobility spatiotemporal data.

## CODING STYLE

* Keep consistent with Tidyverse Rlang style guide at https://style.tidyverse.org
* We target release on CRAN when running on Linux, MacOS and Windows.
* Add all dependencies of movr as Imports in DESCRIPTION.
* Use importFrom instead of import in NAMESPACE file.
* DO NOT edit NAMESPACE file manully. Always update it with roxygen2 or helper script.
* DO NOT edit manuals under man folder manully. Always update it roxygen2 or helper script.
* Always R CMD check against built package instead of project diretory.
