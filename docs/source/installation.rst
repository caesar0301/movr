Platform-Specific Instructions
-----------------------------

Ubuntu/Debian
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Install system dependencies:

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install cmake build-essential libglib2.0-dev

macOS
~~~~~

Install system dependencies using Homebrew:

.. code-block:: bash

   brew install cmake glib

Windows
~~~~~~~

Windows builds are now natively supported! The required dependencies are automatically installed during package installation. If you encounter issues, you can manually install:

* **Rtools**: Download from `CRAN <https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/>`_ 
* **Optional**: For advanced builds, install `MSYS2 <https://www.msys2.org/>`_ for additional Unix-like tools

Windows (via WSL)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Alternatively, you can use Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL):

1. Install WSL with Ubuntu from Microsoft Store
2. Follow the Ubuntu/Debian installation instructions above

Troubleshooting
--------------

Common Issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~

**CMake not found**
   Make sure CMake is installed and available in your PATH.

**GLib not found**
   Install the GLib development libraries for your system.

**R not found**
   Ensure R is installed and R_HOME is set correctly.

**Build errors on Windows**
   Windows builds are supported natively. Ensure Rtools is installed. If issues persist, try using WSL as an alternative.

**Permission errors**
   Make sure you have write permissions to the R library directory.

Getting Help
-----------

If you encounter installation issues:

* Check the `GitHub Issues <https://github.com/caesar0301/movr/issues>`_ page
* Ensure your system meets the requirements
* Try installing from CRAN first, then from GitHub if needed
* Verify that all system dependencies are installed

Verification
-----------

After installation, verify that `movr` is working correctly:

.. code-block:: r

   library(movr)
   data(movement)
   head(movement)

This should load the package and display the first few rows of the example dataset.
