\usage{
dq.point.dynamic(x, y, t)
}
\arguments{
\item{x, y, t}{input for \code{\link{stcoords}}. If x and y represent longitude and
latitude respectively, please make sure that longitude is located as the first param.}
}
\value{
theta the speed index

U the uncertainty

Q the unified quality indicator for each data point

H the entropic quality indicator for each user
}
\description{
In the paper, Iovan et al.[1] addressed user sampling issues from local and global
aspects, respectively. The local measures quantify the quality of each observation
point for each individual, which include speed index (theta), uncertainty (U),
and a unified quality indicator (Q) based of previous two metrics. The global measure (H)
quantifies the data quality for a whole trajectory, by considering the information entropy
of a vector of quality indicators (Q).
